# SVACC Method: Systematic Video And Content Creation

## Overview

SVACC (Systematic Video And Content Creation) is a universal, agentic framework for producing high-quality video, educational, and written content using AI. Inspired by the BMAD Method for software, SVACC brings Agile-style, role-based workflows to creators, educators, marketers, and indie filmmakers.

SVACC orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents—each with a creative or production role—to take your idea from brainstorm to published product. It supports YouTube videos, blogs, books, courses, documentaries, and more.

## Key Innovations

1. **Agentic Planning**: Dedicated agents (Brainstorm, Research, Content Spec) collaborate to create detailed, consistent content briefs and production specs. Human-in-the-loop refinement ensures creative vision and accuracy.
2. **Context-Engineered Production**: Script Planner, Design, Producer, and Direction agents transform plans into actionable stories, scripts, visuals, and production schedules. QA and Launch agents ensure quality and successful publishing.

This two-phase approach eliminates planning inconsistency and context loss, the biggest problems in creative workflows.

## Supported Content Types
- YouTube videos (educational, storytelling, tutorials)
- Blogs/articles (short and long-form)
- Fiction and non-fiction books
- Courses (Udemy, LMS platforms)
- Short films, movies, documentaries

## Agentic Workflow

1. **Brainstorm Agent**: Ideates content themes and angles
2. **Research Agent**: Gathers data, trends, and inspiration
3. **Content Spec Agent**: Creates a PRD-style spec (objective, audience, outline, format)
4. **Script Planner Agent**: Breaks content into epics/stories (chapters, scenes, modules)
5. **Design Agent**: Generates visuals, thumbnails, layouts, storyboards
6. **Producer Agent**: Converts plan into a production schedule
7. **Direction Agent**: Executes production (video, audio, editing)
8. **QA Agent**: Verifies quality, consistency, and alignment
9. **Launch Agent**: Publishes to platforms (YouTube, Kindle, LMS, Substack)

## Workflow Phases

- **Ideation**: Brainstorm & Research
- **Specification**: Content Spec & Script Planning
- **Design**: Visuals, storyboards, layouts
- **Production**: Scheduling, execution, editing
- **QA & Launch**: Review, publish, promote
